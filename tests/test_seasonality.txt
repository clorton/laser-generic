Make a plan for a comprehensive set of tests of transmission with seasonal forcing
using the seasonality argument of TransmissionSIX (SI model), TransmissionSI (SIR model),
and TransmissionSE (SEIR model). For each model run with a reasonable beta and no
seasonality (seasonality = None). Then, for each model run with seasonality attenuating
the transmission to one half and with seasonality amplifying the transmission to
twice the stated rate. Compare the results to validate the effect of seasonality.
For the SIR and SEIR model use the kermack-mckendrick values to validate. For the
SI model, check the rate of infection to validate the effect of seasonality.
